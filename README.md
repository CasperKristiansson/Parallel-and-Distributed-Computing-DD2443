# Parallel and Distributed Computing DD2443 

## Course contents

The course is an advanced course in parallel and distributed computations, dealing with the following subjects:

- models, fundamental concepts and analytical methods for parallel and distributed systems, fundamental limitations and impossibility results
- algorithms and protocols for commonly occurring computing problems in communication, synchronisation, fault tolerance, coordination, consensus and replication, sharing and security, and distributed storing.

The course assumes interest for programming and theoretical issues.

## Intended learning outcomes

After passing the course, the student should be able to

- account for models, limitations and fundamental concepts within parallel computations with communication based both on message passing and shared memory
- apply and adapt existing algorithms and develop new algorithms for execution on parallel and distributed machines and analyse these algorithms with regard to correctness, security and performance.
